# Basic Postfix settings
###############################################################################


# COMPATIBILITY
#
# The compatibility_level determines what default settings Postfix
# will use for main.cf and master.cf settings. These defaults will
# change over time.
#
# To avoid breaking things, Postfix will use backwards-compatible
# default settings and log where it uses those old backwards-compatible
# default settings, until the system administrator has determined
# if any backwards-compatible default settings need to be made
# permanent in main.cf or master.cf.
#
# When this review is complete, update the compatibility_level setting
# below as recommended in the RELEASE_NOTES file.
#
# The level below is what should be used with new (not upgrade) installs.
#
compatibility_level = 3.6

# Whether or not to use the local biff service. This service sends "new mail"
# notifications to users who have requested new mail notification with the
# UNIX command "biff y". 
biff = no

# Appending .domain is the MUA's job. Default: Postfix >= 3.0: no
append_dot_mydomain = no

# Created from ENV and substituted to /etc/postfix/env.cf
# mydomain = domain.tld

# The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to
# come from, and that locally posted mail is delivered to. The default,
# $myhostname, is adequate for small sites. (default: $myhostname)
# Created from ENV and substituted to /etc/postfix/env.cf
# myorigin = domain.tld

# "myhostname" should resolve to the IP of your mailserver. In general that's
# the Kubernetes worker node the Postfix container runs on.
# Created from ENV and substituted to /etc/postfix/env.cf
# myhostname = mail.$mydomain

# The list of domains that are delivered via the $local_transport
# mail delivery transport. By default this is the Postfix local(8) delivery
# agent which looks up all recipients in /etc/passwd, /etc/aliases and
# /etc/mail/aliases.
# In this case it is sufficient to handle only local mails for domain
# "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain". That's mainly for locally
# generated (error) mails in the pod so that the mails can be forwarded
# elsewhere like a IMAP server. Most (virtual) mail domains/user are
# handled in the "$virtual_*" directives.
mydestination = localhost localhost.localdomain

# The list of "trusted" remote SMTP clients that have more privileges
# than "strangers". In particular, "trusted" SMTP clients are allowed
# to relay mail through Postfix. See the smtpd_relay_restrictions
# parameter description in the postconf(5) manual. You can specify the
# list of "trusted" network addresses by hand or you can let Postfix
# do it for you (which is the default). See the description of the
# "mynetworks_style" parameter for more information.
# We basically allow "localhost (127.0.0.1)" relaying mails. I additionally
# allowed my VPN hosts which are part of my 10.3.0.0/24 network (that's
# basically the network that all Kubernetes nodes belong to).
mynetworks = 127.0.0.1/32 10.3.0.0/24 172.16.0.0/12

# You MUST specify $myhostname at the start of the text. This is required
# by the SMTP protocol. (default: $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name)
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name


# The  maximal  size  of any local(8) individual mailbox or maildir file,
# or zero (no limit).
mailbox_size_limit = 0
# The maximal size in bytes of a message, including envelope information.
# Note: be careful when making changes. Excessively small values will result
# in the loss of non-delivery notifications, when a bounce message size
# exceeds the local or remote MTA's message size limit.

# Avoid warning: smtputf8_enable is true, but EAI support is not compiled in
smtputf8_enable = no

# When a mailbox file is not owned by its recipient, the local and
# virtual delivery agents now log a warning and defer delivery.
# Specify "strict_mailbox_ownership = no" to ignore such ownership
# discrepancies.
strict_mailbox_ownership = no

# Better forward secrecy settings. With prime-field EDH, OpenSSL wants the
# server to provide two explicitly-selected (prime, generator) combinations.
# One for the now long-obsolete "export" cipher suites, and another for
# non-export cipher suites. Postfix has two such default combinations
# compiled in, but also supports explicitly-configured overrides.

# blacklists with served me very well over the last years to filter spam mail
# (actually they work so good that I don't use any spam filter besides
# Thunderbird's spam filter for the very few spam mails that get's through).
